# AI API Interface Documentation

## Overview

The AI API Interface is a modern web-based graphical interface for connecting to different AI API services. It allows users to input API details and interact with various AI services through a sleek, Intel-blue-themed design.

## Features

- **Dynamic API Input**: Manage multiple AI API endpoints in one place
- **Secure Authentication**: User authentication and access control for secure API usage
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, responsive, and user-friendly design with Intel-blue theming
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Track API usage and view detailed logs
- **Scalability**: Built to support multiple users and API services
- **Azure Deployment**: Easily deployable to Azure cloud

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Deployment**: Azure App Service, Key Vault, Application Insights, and Storage Account

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm (v7 or later)
- Azure CLI (for deployment)
- Azure subscription (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Start the backend development server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

### Testing

The project includes scripts for functionality and security testing:

```
cd deployment
./test.sh          # Run functionality tests
./security-test.sh # Run security tests
```

### Deployment to Azure

To deploy the application to Azure:

1. Ensure you have Azure CLI installed and configured
2. Navigate to the deployment directory:
   ```
   cd deployment
   ```
3. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment

## Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control
- Secure API key storage
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized React components with proper state management
